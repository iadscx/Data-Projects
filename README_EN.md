#  Data Analysis and Engineering Portfolio
🌐 **[Versión en Español](README.md)**

I’m **Irvin Diaz**, a **Petroleum Engineering student at UNAM** with a deep passion for data and the engineering that lies behind it.  

I am currently building my professional path in the world of data, strengthening my skills to **extract, clean, process, and automate information** to support better decision-making.  

I have participated in projects related to the **oil and gas industry**, mainly within **PEMEX**, which are **confidential and property of the Mexican Government**, and therefore **cannot be shared publicly**.  

However, I am developing **personal and practice projects** that reflect the same skills and methodologies applied in real-world data environments.  

My current goal is to **transition into new industries** where I can continue to apply and expand my knowledge in **data design, management, processing, and analysis**.
